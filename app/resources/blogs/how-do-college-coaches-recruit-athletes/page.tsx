          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            College coaches recruit athletes using a structured process that evaluates talent, academic performance, and character. 
            Their goal is to find players who excel on the field and can also contribute to the team's culture and success. 
            For aspiring college athletes, understanding this process can make the difference between being overlooked and landing 
            a spot on the roster.

            The Recruiting Funnel: What Coaches Look For
          </h2>
          <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The recruiting process is like a funnel. Coaches start with a large pool of potential recruits and narrow it down 
              as they evaluate skills, academic performance, and fit for their team. Your goal is to progress through each stage 
              by consistently standing out.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
              Coaches begin by identifying talent through highlight videos, showcases, tournaments, and camps. These events allow 
              them to assess players' technical skills and game performance. However, moving deeper into the process requires more 
              than athletic ability—coaches look for well-rounded players who demonstrate leadership, maintain good grades, and 
              proactively communicate their interest.

            Stand Out by Excelling On and Off the Field
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Skill alone won't guarantee you a spot on a college team. Coaches are looking for well-rounded players who bring value 
            both on and off the field. Academic performance plays a huge role in setting you apart. A strong GPA not only ensures 
            eligibility but can also make you eligible for higher scholarships, which can be a deciding factor for coaches balancing 
            team budgets.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Off the field, how you present yourself matters just as much. Coaches pay attention to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Your mannerisms and character</li>

            Soccer recruiting is fiercely competitive, which means starting early and taking control of the process is essential. 
            Begin by researching programs that match your athletic and academic goals. Create a standout highlight video that 
            showcases your skills, tactical understanding, and potential.

              On the field, consistency and growth are what set top players apart. Coaches aren't just looking for raw talent—they 
              want athletes who are constantly improving and able to adapt to higher levels of competition.
